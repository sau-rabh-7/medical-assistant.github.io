    headache: [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `Hi ${patientContext.name}, ` : 'Hello, '}I see you're dealing with a headache. These can be quite uncomfortable. From what you're describing, it could be tension-related, especially if you've been under stress lately, or it might be due to dehydration or lack of sleep. Have you been drinking enough water today? I'd suggest finding a quiet, dark room to rest in for a bit. A cool compress on your forehead might help too. If you have some ibuprofen or acetaminophen at home, that could provide relief, but make sure to follow the dosage instructions.`,
      `Now, I want you to keep an eye on this headache. If it becomes severe, happens frequently, or if you notice any changes in your vision, neck stiffness, or develop a fever along with it, I'd want you to see a doctor right away. Those could be signs of something more serious that needs immediate attention.`
    ],
    fever: [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `${patientContext.name}, ` : ''}a fever tells me your body is working hard to fight off something, likely an infection. That's actually a good sign that your immune system is doing its job. Right now, focus on staying well-hydrated - water, herbal teas, or clear broths are all good choices. Rest is crucial too, so don't feel guilty about taking it easy. You can use fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help you feel more comfortable, but don't feel like you have to bring the fever down completely.`,
      `I do want you to monitor your temperature though. If it climbs above 103Â°F or stays elevated for more than three days, that's when I'd want you to come in. Also, watch for any trouble breathing, severe headache, or persistent vomiting - those would be reasons to seek care sooner rather than later.`
    ],
    cough: [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `I hear you, ${patientContext.name}, ` : ''}coughs can be really annoying, can't they? There are several things that could be causing this - it might be a viral infection, allergies acting up, or even just irritation from dry air or strong smells. For now, try to stay hydrated as it helps thin any mucus. A spoonful of honey can be surprisingly effective for soothing your throat, and warm tea with lemon might feel good too. If the air in your home is dry, a humidifier could help.`,
      `Keep track of how long this cough lasts. If it's still bothering you after two weeks, or if you start coughing up blood, or develop fever and difficulty breathing along with it, those are signals that we need to take a closer look at what's going on.`
    ],
    "stomach pain": [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `${patientContext.name}, ` : ''}stomach pain can have so many different causes, and I know how uncomfortable it can be. Think about when it started - was it after eating something specific? Are you feeling stressed? Sometimes our digestive system really responds to what's going on in our lives. For now, try sticking to bland, easy-to-digest foods like toast, rice, or bananas. Avoid anything spicy, greasy, or acidic for a day or two.`,
      `Pay attention to where exactly the pain is and how it feels - is it cramping, sharp, or more of a dull ache? If the pain becomes severe, you start vomiting blood, or you become dehydrated, don't wait - get medical help right away. Those are signs we can't ignore.`
    ],
    "rash": [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `${patientContext.name}, ` : ''}rashes can be tricky because they can have so many different causes. Let me help you think through this. First, when did you first notice it? Has it been getting worse, better, or staying the same? Think about whether you've used any new soaps, detergents, or skincare products recently. Sometimes our skin reacts to things we've been fine with before, especially if we're stressed or our immune system is a bit run down.`,
      `For now, try to keep the area clean and dry, and avoid scratching if you can - I know that's easier said than done! If it's itchy, a cool, damp cloth might provide some relief. Avoid any new products on the area until we figure out what's going on. If the rash is spreading quickly, you develop a fever, or if you have any trouble breathing, those would be reasons to seek immediate care.`
    ],
    "rashes between thighs": [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `I understand, ${patientContext.name}, ` : ''}rashes in that area can be really uncomfortable and I know it might feel awkward to talk about, but this is actually pretty common. This type of rash often happens because of friction and moisture - especially if you've been more active lately, wearing tight clothing, or if it's been hot and humid. It could also be a fungal infection, which thrives in warm, moist areas.`,
      `Here's what I'd suggest: keep the area as clean and dry as possible, wear loose-fitting, breathable cotton underwear and clothing when you can. After showering, make sure to dry the area thoroughly - you can even use a hair dryer on cool setting if that helps. Some people find that antifungal powder or cream helps, but if it doesn't improve in a few days or gets worse, definitely see a doctor. If you develop fever, the rash spreads significantly, or you notice any discharge with a strong odor, those would be reasons to seek care sooner.`
    ],
    "itching": [
      `${patientContext?.name ? `${patientContext.name}, ` : ''}itching can be so frustrating, can't it? Let's think about what might be causing this. Has it started recently or has this been going on for a while? Are you seeing any rash or just feeling the itching? Sometimes dry skin is the culprit, especially if the weather's been dry or you've been taking hot showers. Other times it could be an allergic reaction to something new you've encountered.`,
      `Try to avoid scratching as much as possible - I know it's hard! Cool compresses can help, and keeping your skin moisturized with a gentle, fragrance-free lotion might provide relief. If you're taking any new medications, that could also be the cause. If the itching is severe, widespread, or you develop hives or swelling, especially around your face or throat, seek medical attention right away.`
